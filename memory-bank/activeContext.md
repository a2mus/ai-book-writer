# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on completing the in-progress tasks identified in the project progress report. This includes enhancing the testing framework, improving error handling, and refining the output formatting system.

## Recent Changes
- Project restructured from book writer to article writer.
- Basic directory structure established.
- Configuration system updated.
- Military terminology integration framework implemented.
- Specialized agents defined and implemented.
- Terminology handler and glossary integration completed.
- Article generation pipeline (outline, section generation, assembly) is functional.
- Initial documentation created (`README.md`, system architecture, terminology handling).

## Next Steps
The immediate next steps are derived from the "Next Immediate Actions" in the project progress:
1.  **Testing Enhancement:** Complete unit tests for terminology handler, implement integration tests for full article generation, and add test coverage for bilingual support.
2.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for terminology lookups, add validation for language switching, and create error recovery mechanisms.
3.  **Output System:** Create article templates, implement multiple output format support, and enhance glossary generation.
4.  **Documentation:** Add API documentation, create user guides, and document testing procedures.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritizing the completion of the testing framework to ensure system stability.
- Addressing error handling as a critical area for immediate attention.
- Continuously updating documentation to reflect the current state of the project.
- Ensuring regular validation of terminology accuracy.

## Current Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the AI Article Writer project.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Created core memory bank files:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`

## Next Steps
- Create `activeContext.md` (this file).
- Create `progress.md`.
- Review all created memory bank files for completeness and accuracy.

## Active Considerations
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the current project state and documentation.
- Preparing the memory bank for future updates and task management.
