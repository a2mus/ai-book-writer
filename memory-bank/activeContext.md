# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Ensuring system stability and reliability after recent dependency updates.
- Monitoring the article generation pipeline for successful end-to-end runs.
- Continuing to enhance testing, error handling, and output formatting as top priorities.

## Recent Changes
- Resolved ModuleNotFoundError for `duckduckgo_search` by updating and installing all dependencies via `requirements.txt`.
- Confirmed successful initialization and operation of the article generation system, including multi-agent orchestration and outline generation.
- System now reliably loads military glossary and generates structured outlines in Arabic, adhering to terminology and formatting requirements.
- No critical runtime errors observed in recent runs.

## Next Steps
1. **Testing Enhancement:** Complete unit and integration tests for terminology handler and article generation, including bilingual support.
2. **Error Handling:** Finalize robust error handling for terminology lookups, language switching, and agent failures.
3. **Output System:** Implement article templates, support for multiple output formats, and enhanced glossary generation.
4. **Documentation:** Add API documentation, user guides, and document testing procedures.
5. **Dependency Management:** Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent similar issues.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritizing completion of the testing framework and error handling improvements.
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation and memory bank records.
- Regularly validating terminology accuracy and agent collaboration.
- Ensuring reproducibility by keeping requirements.txt current and monitoring for dependency issues.
