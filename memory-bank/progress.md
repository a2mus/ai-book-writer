# Project Progress

## Status as of May 2025

### Completed Components

- Core Infrastructure (Project restructured, directory structure, config updated, terminology framework)
- Agent System (Specialized agents defined and implemented: Writer, Editor, Researcher, Outline Creator, Formatter, Terminology Checker)
- Military Terminology Support (Handler implementation, glossary integration, bilingual support, term suggestion)
- Article Generation Pipeline (Outline generation, section-based content, terminology verification, article assembly)
- Documentation (README.md updated, System architecture, Terminology handling, Basic test framework)
- Dependency Management (Resolved ModuleNotFoundError for `duckduckgo_search` and ensured all dependencies are installed via `requirements.txt`)
- System Reliability (Confirmed successful initialization and operation of the article generation system, including multi-agent orchestration and outline generation)

### In Progress

- Testing Framework (Unit tests for terminology, Integration tests, Edge case tests)
- Output Formatting (Article template, Multiple output formats, Glossary generation)
- Error Handling (Terminology validation, Language switching robustness, Error recovery)

### Pending Tasks

- Enhanced Features (Embeddings for matching, Term frequency analysis, Cross-language verification, Automated glossary suggestions)
- Quality Assurance (Performance optimization, Code coverage, Documentation completion, Security review)
- User Interface (CLI improvements, Interactive mode, Progress visualization)
- Infrastructure (Caching for terminology, Backup/recovery, Logging enhancement)

### Next Immediate Actions

1. Testing Enhancement (Complete unit tests, Implement integration tests, Add bilingual test coverage)
2. Error Handling (Robust error handling for lookups, Validate language switching, Create error recovery)
3. Output System (Create article templates, Implement multiple formats, Enhance glossary generation)
4. Documentation (Add API docs, Create user guides, Document testing procedures)
5. Dependency Management (Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent similar issues)

### Long-term Goals

1. Performance Optimization (Caching, Optimize lookups, Enhance parallel processing)
2. Feature Enhancement (Additional languages, Advanced NLP, Terminology visualization)
3. User Experience (Interactive CLI, Progress tracking, Configuration management)

### Notes

- Priority: Completing the testing framework and error handling improvements
- Recent dependency issues have been resolved; requirements.txt is current and reproducible
- System is running reliably and producing structured outlines as expected
- Documentation and memory bank should be updated continuously
- Regular validation of terminology accuracy is critical
