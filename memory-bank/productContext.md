# Product Context

## Purpose
The AI Article Writer project aims to automate the generation of high-quality articles, specifically focusing on content that requires accurate and consistent use of military terminology.

## Problem Solved
This system addresses the challenge of creating technical or specialized articles where precise language and adherence to specific terminology standards are critical. It helps ensure that military terms are used correctly and consistently, which is particularly important for documentation, reports, or educational materials.

## How it Works
The system operates through a collaborative multi-agent framework. Users provide a topic, and specialized agents (Writer, Editor, Researcher, Outline Creator, Formatter, Terminology Checker) work together in a pipeline. The process involves generating an outline, writing content section by section, verifying terminology against a military glossary, and assembling the final article.

## User Experience Goals
- Provide an easy way for users to request articles on specific topics.
- Generate articles that are well-structured, informative, and engaging.
- Ensure the final output adheres strictly to military terminology standards.
- Support content generation in both Arabic and French.
- Offer a clear and understandable process, even with the complex multi-agent backend.
