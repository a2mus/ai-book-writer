# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **AutoGen:** Multi-agent conversation framework.
- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **CSV:** Format for the military terminology glossary.
- **Markdown:** Format for documentation and potentially article output.

## Development Setup
- The project is structured with directories for agents, documentation, tests, and utilities.
- Configuration is managed in `config.py`.
- The military glossary is expected as a CSV file (`glossaire_2022_sample.csv`).

## Technical Constraints
- Reliance on the AutoGen framework for agent interaction.
- The quality of terminology handling is dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the provided CSV glossary.
- Current implementation uses a specific Ollama model (`command-r7b-arabic:7b-02-2025-q8_0`) which may impact performance and output quality depending on the environment.
- Bilingual support is currently limited to Arabic and French based on the provided glossary.

## Dependencies
- AutoGen library.
- Standard Python libraries (e.g., `csv`, `re`).
- An accessible language model compatible with AutoGen (currently configured for Ollama).
